# WPF application signing in users with Microsoft and calling the Microsoft Graph

| [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-mobileanddesktopapp-windowsdesktop-intro)| [Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki) | [Docs](https://aka.ms/aadv2) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support)

This simple sample demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) to get an access token and call the Microsoft Graph (using OAuth 2.0 against the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint).

## Steps to Run

You can get full explanation about this sample, and build it from scratch by going to [Windows desktop .NET guided walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-mobileanddesktopapp-windowsdesktop-intro).

This sample is pre-configured. If you just want to quickly run it just:

1. Clone the code.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2.git
```

2.  Run the application from Visual Studio (Debug | Start without Debugging)

### [Optional] Use your own application coordinates

If you want to use your own application coordinates:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation:
1. On Windows run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:
   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```
1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordinly. 
   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```
   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start

If ou don't want to use this automation, follow the steps below

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select `Directory + Subscription` at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and switch your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.   
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.

#### Register the client app (WpfApp)

1. In **App registrations (Preview)** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WpfApp`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
    - Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **Authentication**.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** | **Suggested Redirect URIs for public clients (mobile, desktop)** section, check **urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob**
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.Read**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button


### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the client project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `active-directory-wpf-msgraph-v2\App.xaml.cs` file
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WpfApp` application copied from the Azure portal.

### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.
